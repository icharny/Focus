Focus is a masking view that allows you to focus on or highlight UI elements. It is easy to use and highly customizable - you can call it with a single function call and choose between circular fades and rectangular blurs. Focus is great for tutorials or walkthrough where attention needs to be directed to a certain area of the screen.
